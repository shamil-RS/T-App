# T-App
Sample interface for Tinkoff mobile Bank

This application is an example of an interface for the Tinkoff mobile bank, which implements the functionality of the first window, where users can view transaction histories. The app allows you to leave comments on stories, as well as respond to them with various reactions.

Technologies and architecture

The application is developed using modern technologies, such as Dagger Hilt for implementing dependencies and the MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern for managing the state of the user interface.

Dagger Hilt: This is a library for simplifying dependency injection in Android apps. It provides a convenient way to manage dependencies and their lifecycle.

MVI (Model-View-Intent): This architecture pattern helps you organize your application code by dividing it into three main components: model (state), view (UI), and intent (user actions). This makes the app more predictable and easier to maintain.

Functional features

View Stories: Users can easily view their transaction histories.

Comments: The ability to leave comments on each story, which promotes interaction between users.

Reactions: Users can express their emotions towards stories through reactions, which adds an element of social activity to the app.
